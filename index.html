                >Jesus Christ</a
              >
              was born circa 6 B.C. in Bethlehem. Little is known about his
              early life, but his life and his ministry are recorded in the New
              Testament, more a theological document than a biography. According
              to Christians, Jesus is considered the incarnation of God and his
              teachings are followed as an example for living a more spiritual
              life. Christians believe he died for the sins of all people and
              rose from the dead.

            <h2>The Sermon On the Mount</h2>

            <p>
              5 Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat
              down, his disciples came to him. 2 And he opened his mouth and
              taught them, saying: 3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
              is the kingdom of heaven. 4 “Blessed are those who mourn, for they
              shall be comforted. 5 “Blessed are the meek, for they shall
              inherit the earth. 6 “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for
              righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. 7 “Blessed are the
              merciful, for they shall receive mercy. 8 “Blessed are the pure in
              heart, for they shall see God. 9 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for
              they shall be called sons[a] of God. 10 “Blessed are those who are
              persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
              heaven. 11 “Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute
              you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
              12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so
              they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and Light
              13 “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste,
              how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for
              anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
              14 “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be
              hidden. 15 Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,
              but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. 16 In the
              same way, let your light shine before others, so that[b] they may
              see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in
              heaven. 17 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or
              the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
              18 For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not
              an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is
              accomplished. 19 Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of
              these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be
              called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and
              teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For
              I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes
              and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 21 “You
              have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not
              murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ 22 But I
              say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother[c] will be
              liable to judgment; whoever insults[d] his brother will be liable
              to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to
              the hell[e] of fire. 23 So if you are offering your gift at the
              altar and there remember that your brother has something against
              you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be
              reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. 25
              Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with
              him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and
              the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. 26 Truly, I say
              to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last
              penny.[f] 27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not
              commit adultery.’ 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a
              woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her
              in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out
              and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your
              members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. 30 And if
              your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.
              For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your
              whole body go into hell. 31 “It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces
              his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ 32 But I say
              to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground
              of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever
              marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 33 “Again you have
              heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear
              falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.’ 34
              But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven,
              for it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, for it is his
              footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
              36 And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one
              hair white or black. 37 Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’;
              anything more than this comes from evil.[g] 38 “You have heard
              that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ 39
              But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone
              slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 And
              if anyone would sue you and take your tunic,[h] let him have your
              cloak as well. 41 And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with
              him two miles. 42 Give to the one who begs from you, and do not
              refuse the one who would borrow from you. 43 “You have heard that
              it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
              44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who
              persecute you, 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in
              heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and
              sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those
              who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax
              collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet only your brothers,[i]
              what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do
              the same? 48 You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly
              Father is perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
              6 “Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in
              order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from
              your Father who is in heaven. 2 “Thus, when you give to the needy,
              sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the
              synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others.
              Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 3 But when
              you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your
              right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. And
              your Father who sees in secret will reward you. The Lord's Prayer
              5 “And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For
              they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street
              corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you,
              they have received their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your
              room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret.
              And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 7 “And when
              you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for
              they think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 Do not
              be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask
              him. 9 Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be
              your name.[j] 10 Your kingdom come, your will be done,[k] on earth
              as it is in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread,[l] 12 and
              forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And
              lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.[m] 14 For
              if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
              also forgive you, 15 but if you do not forgive others their
              trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
              Fasting 16 “And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the
              hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may
              be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their
              reward. 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
              18 that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father
              who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward
              you. Lay Up Treasures in Heaven 19 “Do not lay up for yourselves
              treasures on earth, where moth and rust[n] destroy and where
              thieves break in and steal, 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures
              in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves
              do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there
              your heart will be also. 22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. So,
              if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, 23
              but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
              If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
              24 “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one
              and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise
              the other. You cannot serve God and money.[o] Do Not Be Anxious 25
              “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you
              will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you
              will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than
              clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor
              reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds
              them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And which of you by
              being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?[p] 28 And
              why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the
              field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell
              you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
              these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which
              today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not
              much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not
              be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’
              or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the Gentiles seek after all these
              things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 33
              But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
              these things will be added to you. 34 “Therefore do not be anxious
              about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
              Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. Judging Others
            </p>

            <p>
              7 “Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 For with the judgment you
              pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will
              be measured to you. 3 Why do you see the speck that is in your
              brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
              4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out
              of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? 5 You
              hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you
              will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. 6
              “Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls
              before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack
              you. Ask, and It Will Be Given 7 “Ask, and it will be given to
              you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
              8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and
              to the one who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or which one of you, if
              his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he
              asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? 11 If you then, who are
              evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
              will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who
              ask him! The Golden Rule 12 “So whatever you wish that others
              would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the
              Prophets. 13 “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and
              the way is easy[q] that leads to destruction, and those who enter
              by it are many. 14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that
              leads to life, and those who find it are few. A Tree and Its Fruit
              15 “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing
              but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will recognize them by
              their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from
              thistles? 17 So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the
              diseased tree bears bad fruit. 18 A healthy tree cannot bear bad
              fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that
              does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20
              Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. I Never Knew You 21
              “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom
              of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in
              heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we
              not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and
              do many mighty works in your name?’ 23 And then will I declare to
              them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of
              lawlessness.’ Build Your House on the Rock 24 “Everyone then who
              hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man
              who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the
              floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did
              not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone
              who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a
              foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell,
              and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that
              house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” The Authority
              of Jesus 28 And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were
              astonished at his teaching, 29 for he was teaching them as one who
              had authority, and not as their scribes.
